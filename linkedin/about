Experienced programmer driven by the changing trends and capabilities of software development. I have experience working on full-stack projects with complex front-end user interactions, or developing frameworks to automate business tasks.

I have a love of working and experimenting with object-oriented code, including design patterns to create a maintainable, extensible and testable code bases.
